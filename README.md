# Ministry of Education CWP Core

Stores the basic data types and functionality that should be present on any
website managed by MoE. This module installs the required SilverStripe CWP 
modules and common modules + extensions.

Please note that while some of our websites share design assets (such as 
education.govt.nz and gazette.govt.nz) not all sites share this style. In these 
cases they normally build off the `education-core` module. `education-core` 
module provides standard fonts etc for ministry branding.

## Used on

 * education.govt.nz
 * parents.education.govt.nz
 * gazette.education.govt.nz
 * tec.govt.nz
 * youthguarantee.net.nz

## What this doesn't include

This module does not include front-end styles, pagetypes or anything like that
at this stage. This module is focused on the backend. For generic front-end 
styles and things like standard `education.govt.nz` footer check out the 
`education-core` module.

## Features

### Include Standard Modules

All CWP core, search, queued jobs and helpful additions.

### Standard Reports

### Standard SEO
