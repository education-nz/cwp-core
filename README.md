# Ministry of Education CWP Core

Stores the basic data types and functionality that should be present on any
website managed by MoE. This module installs the required SilverStripe CWP 
modules and common modules + extensions.

Please note that while some of our websites share design assets (such as 
education.govt.nz and gazette.govt.nz) not all sites share this style. In these 
cases they normally build off the `education-core` module. `education-core` 
module provides standard fonts etc for ministry branding.
